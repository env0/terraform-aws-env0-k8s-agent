To use this module in your own configuration create an input variable `modules_info`:
```json
{
	"vpc": {
		"create": false,
		"id": "vpc-092f26b605570e54e",
		"private_subnets": ["subnet-091d4e565774c76bc", "subnet-095cdaad02d57a8d6", "subnet-01c8446e75547eeef", "subnet-0729b32d54b3216c4", "subnet-01e93749f16d100bf"]
	},
	"efs": {
		"create": false,
		"id": "fs-0ed81547beb39d684"
	},
	"eks": {
		"create": false,
		"cluster_id": "elad-eks8"
	},
	"autoscaler": {
		"create": false
	},
	"csi_driver": {

```terraform
module "my-agent-eks-cluster" {
  source  = "env0/env0-k8s-agent/aws"

  region            = var.region
  cluster_name      = var.cluster_name
  modules_info      = var.modules_info
}
```
